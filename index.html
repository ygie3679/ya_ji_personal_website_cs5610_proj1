      I finished my first master's degree in Quantitative Finance in 2022, during when I found my
      interest in computer science. I have experience working with various programming languages
      like Python, Java, C/C++, HTML/CSS, and JavaScript, and have completed implementation
      of a full-stack web application.

    <p>
      With skills in cloud computing, familiarity with developer tools, and good knowledge of software
      development methodologies and principles, I acquire strong technical expertise
      in full-stack development.
